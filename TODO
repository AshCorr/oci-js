- VERY IMPORTANT: come up with a dank name for this library
- Support Docker authentication to Registry
- Clean up Build
- Actually having tests for stuff would be nice.
  - Use ZOD to run integration tests in a container
- Switch to MIT instead of AGPL?
- Add a README with instructions
- Publish to NPM (probably not for a while...)
