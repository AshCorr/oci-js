# oci-js

A low level node library to build OCI Artifacts and interact with OCI Registries.

My intention is to be able to use this library to create GHA actions capable of bundling compiled code and publishing it to GHCR.

This project is still very early in development, see (TODO)[./TODO] for my somewhat messy list of what needs doing next!
